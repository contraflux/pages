                Over the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to learn about and work with radars at
                MIT. The radar was a small ultra-wideband radar called the PulsON P440, and we communicated
                with it via Python scripts from a Raspberry Pi.

            <p class="text">
                The project consisted of a few phases, the first of which was writing the python program
                to interact with the PulsON 440. The data gained from the radar was then plotted on a
                range-time intensity plot, with range on the x-axis and time on the y-axis.

                We noticed it could be difficult to make out small objects or objects at far distances
                due to the radar's limited power, so we also created delta range-time intensity plots,
                which subtract two adjacent pulses to find the differences between them. Along with
                making motion easier to see, these plots had the added benefit of reducing the large
                initial pulse detected by the receiving antenna as the radar is transmitting.

                Once we had developed a method for plotting our radar returns, we focused on creating
                synthetic aperture radar maps. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a technique used to
                increase resolution by overlaying multiple scans of the same target area. The same effect
                can be achieved by making your radar aperture far larger, so in some sense you're creating
                a synthetic aperture by moving the radar. To create our images, we flew the radar on
                drones in MIT's high bay. We then used a system of infrared tracking cameras to get
                position data on the drone, and lined it up with our scan. We then combined the motion
                capture and radar data to form our own maps, generally of aluminum soda cans placed
                on the floor.

                 The final challenge was to use this technique to discover the pattern of soda cans

            <p class="text">
                In the last week of the program, we were introduced to one possible application of synthetic
                aperture radar: using it to detect buried landmines. Representatives from MIT's Lincoln
                Laboratory presented the topic and explained that they too had been assigned to a similar
                project. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                To see if we could pick up the landmine, we went to one of the sand pits and set the
                radar up on a cart attached to a zipline. The cart would move across the wire at a constant
                speed, and had an encoder so we could know its position along the line. We then set
                up two refelectors, one in each corner of the sand pit, to act as references, and buried
                the landmine around one foot under the sand.

                We did end up detecting the landmine. Figure 3-2 is a horizontal cross section
                of the sand pit, with the surface of the sand at 0m on the y-axis. The two reference
                reflectors are at 2m and 11m on the x-axis, and the landmine is clearly visible at 7m
                on the x-axis and about 0.5m under the surface.

                Of the five teams in the program, we were one of two that discovered the soda can pattern,
                and the only one to successfully detect the landmine.
