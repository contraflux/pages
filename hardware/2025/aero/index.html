            <p class="text">
                On the solid propulsion subteam I worked to optimize the team's rocket nozzle. The
                previous design (24-25 C) was a conical converging-diverging nozzle with converging
                and diverging half angles of 40 and 15 degrees respectively, and an expansion ratio
                of 4.49.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                To increase performance, I rederived all the required parameters starting from a chamber
                pressure of 590 PSI from last year's static hotfire and our known grain geometry. I
                found the mass flow rate, and used it to calculate the throat area. Then I calculated
                the exit Mach number based on the chamber pressure and ambient pressure (assuming sea
                level). I then calculated the expansion ratio, and the exit area.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I found an optimal expansion ratio of 5.81, ~30% higher than last year. To test my calculations,
                I ran two simulations (Figures 1-1 and 1-2) in Ansys Fluent, one with last year's nozzle
                and one with my redesign (25-26 C), and compared the resultant exit pressure, exit velocity,
                and mass flow to calculate thrust and specific impulse for each.

                Altough gaining around 20N of thrust and 0.1s of ISP (Table 1-1), I continued research and found
                a series of journal entries written by an aerospace engineering, Gadicharla Rao, in
                the 1960s, describing a method to increase performance by curving the walls of the diverging
                section. Using Rao's method, I designed a new "Rao" nozzle based on the previously calculated
                expansion ratio (25-26 R), and reran the simulations (Figures 1-3 and 1-4).

                This time I gained around 70N of thrust and 2.6s of ISP (Table 1-1) over the optimized
                conical nozzle. Although there is a larger performance gain, the increase in manufacturing
                complexity might outweigh the small boost in performance.

                Once I had the results of the tests, I created CAD models of both of the two new nozzles.
                They each consist of a graphite throat with a phenolic structure and aluminum nozzle
                washer. The converging sections are identical, with only the diverging sections differing

                For liquid propulsion I developed a simulation in Python to calculate pressure losses
                and mass flow rates through our piping prior to be injected into the combustion chamber.
                We are developing our team's first liquid engine, using kerosene as the fuel and nitrous
                oxide as the oxidizer. The numbers generated by the simulation can be compared to the
                water cold flow tests, and can be used to predict the performance when we switch to
                kerosene.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                To run the simulation, relvant parameters, such as the injector specifications, propellant
                characteristics, and pipe elements and their dimensions, as well as the tank pressure
                and ambient chamber pressure are input (Figure 2-1). The simulation is then run with
                a specified maximum number of iterations, and it will iterate until the solution has
                sufficiently converged. Once solved, the results will print to the console (Figure 2-2).

                The simulation works by calculating the pressure losses through each element, and comparing
                the mass flow through the flowmeter and through the injector. The simulation will iteratively
                vary the mass flow rate of the propellant until continuity is maintained throughout
                the system. By default it checks for a mass flow difference of less than 1e-6 kg/s,
                but this can be sent as an argument to the solve function.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                By tuning the characteristics of the piping elements, the simulation can be made to closely
                approximate the results of actual testing (Table 2-1).
