            <h4>Nozzle Optimization</h4>
            <p>
                My first project was to optimize our rocket nozzle. A nozzle
                consists of two sections, the converging section that funnels
                the exhaust gas to the throat while speeding it up, and then
                the diverging section that allows the gas to expand, further
                icnreasing its velocity. There are five main parameters that
                define a converging-diverging nozzle:
                <br>
                <br> 1. Converging half-angle: The angle between the converging wall and the axial direction
                <br> 2. Diverging half-angle: The angle between the diverging wall and the axial direction
                <br> 3. Entry area: The cross-sectional area of the nozzle at the entry
                <br> 4. Throat area: The cross-sectional area of the nozzle at the throat
                <br> 5. Exit area: The cross-sectional area of the nozzle at the exit
                <br>
                <br>
                From our static hotfire test last year, the peak chamber pressure
                was around 590 PSI. From this pressure and Vieille's Law, I found
                our mass flow rate. From the mass flow rate, chamber pressure, and choked condition
                at the nozzle throat, I then calculated the required throat area. I also then calculated the
                optimal exit Mach number, and from that I then found the optimal expansion ratio, and thus exit area.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found an optimal expansion ratio of 5.81, while our expansion ratio last year was 4.49. To verify
                my calculations, I ran a series of simulations using Ansys Fluent, and calculated the force for each.

                    Table 1: Results from Ansys Fluent simulations of the old
                    24-25 conical nozzle with expansion ratio 4.49 and the new
                    25-26 conical nozzle with expansion ratio 5.81. <br> Exit pressure
                    is relative to the operating pressure, so a value of 0 Pa is really
                    101325 Pa.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                From Table 1, you can see that for the 25-26 conical nozzle the
                exit pressure was closer to the optimum of 0 Pa, which lead to
                increased exit velocies. This lead to increased thrust and
                specific impulse, though the performance increases were less
                than what we had hoped for.
            </p>
            <p>
                To verify that this marginal performance increase made sense,
                I approximated the inverse to the area-Mach relation and found
                a curve for thrust from expansion ratio.

            </div>
            <p>
                From Figure 3 we can see a maximum right around 5.8 yielding
                around 6000 kN, but small increases or decreases in the
                expansion ratio hardly change the thrust. This graph backs
                up the small thrust change see in the CFD runs.
            </p>
            <p>
                After this lackluster result, I continued research into optimizing
                for thrust output, and came acrossa a series of journal entries
                written by G.V.R. Rao describing a method he found for curving
                the diverging section of the nozzle to increase performance.

                He then approximated these ideal wall contours using a circular
                arc close to the throat and a parabola towards the exit. Using the
                expansion ratio and throat radius I found previously, I was able
                to use Rao's charts to design a new nozzle. I then ran the new nozzle
                in Fluent to characterize its performance.

            <p>
                From the results in Table 2, we can see that the Rao nozzle offers
                much larger increases in thrust and specific impulse, though the
                manufacturing complexity might outweigh the potential performance
                increases.

                I then used CAD to create two models of our potential solid
                rocket nozzle for the 2025-26 season. Both had expansion ratios of 5.81, while
                one was a pure conical nozzle and the other was a Rao nozzle. In Figures 7 and 8 below,
                the blue material is the aluminum nozzle washer, the orange is phenolic nozzle body,
                and the grey is graphite throat. The converging half angle in both of these designs
                is 50 degrees.
