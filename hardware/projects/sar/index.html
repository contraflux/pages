            <h2>MIT Synethic Aperture Radar</h2>
            <h4>Range-Time Intensity Plots</h4>
            <p>
                Over the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to learn about
                and work with radars at MIT. The radar was a small ultra-wideband
                radar called the PulsON 440, and we communicated with it via Python
                scripts from a Raspberry Pi.
            </p>
            <div class="figure" style="float: none; display: block; margin: auto; width:600px">
                <img src="assets/imgs/p440.jpeg" style="width:600px;">
                <p>Figure 1: The PulsON 440 mounted below a Raspberry Pi. The two green triangles are log periodic antennae, one for transmitting and one for receiving.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The project consisted of a few phases, the first of which was
                writing the python program to interact with the PulsON 440. The
                data gained from the radar was then plotted on a range-time intensity
                plot, with range on the x-axis and time on the y-axis.
            </p>

                We noticed it could be difficult to make out small objects or
                objects at far distances due to the radar's limited power,
                so we also created delta range-time intensity plots, which subtract
                two adjacent pulses to find the differences between them.
                Along with making motion easier to see, these plots had the added
                benefit of reducing the large initial pulse detected by the receiving
                antenna as the radar is transmitting.

            <h4>Time Domain Backprojection</h4>
            <p>
                Once we had developed a method for plotting our radar returns,
                we focused on creating synthetic aperture radar maps. Synthetic
                aperture radar (SAR) is a technique used to increase resolution
                by overlaying multiple scans of the same target area. The same
                effect can be achieved by making your radar aperture far larger,
                so in some sense you're creating a synthetic aperture by moving
                the radar. To create our images, we flew the radar on drones in
                MIT's high bay. We then used a system of infrared tracking cameras
                to get position data on the drone, and lined it up with our scan.
                We then combined the motion capture and radar data to form our
                own maps, generally of aluminum soda cans placed on the floor.

            </div>
            <p>
                The final challenge was to use this technique to discover the
                pattern of soda cans hidden beneath a tarp on the floor.

            <h4>Demining</h4>
            <p>
                In the last week of the program, we were introduced to one possible
                application of synthetic aperture radar: using it to detect buried
                landmines. Representatives from MIT's Lincoln Laboratory presented
                the topic and explained that they too had been assigned to a similar
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see if we could pick up the landmine, we went to one of the sand pits
                and set the radar up on a cart attached to a zipline. The cart would move
                across the wire at a constant speed, and had an encoder so we could know
                its position along the line. We then set up two refelectors, one in each
                corner of the sand pit, to act as references, and buried the landmine
                around one foot under the sand.
            </p>
            <div class="figure-grid">
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="assets/imgs/sand_pit.jpeg" style="height:350px;">
                    <p>Figure 10: Sand pit and zipline setup</p>

                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="assets/imgs/landmine.png" style="height:350px;">
                    <p>Figure 11: SAR image of the sand pit</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                We did end up detecting the landmine. The figure above is a horizontal cross
                section of the sand pit, with the surface of the sand at 0m on the y-axis. The
                two reference reflectors are at 2m and 11m on the x-axis, and the landmine is
                clearly visible at 7m on the x-axis and about 0.5m under the surface.
            </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                Of the five teams in the program, we were one of two that discovered the
                soda can pattern, and the only one to successfully detect the landmine.
